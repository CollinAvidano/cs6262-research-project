## Project Overview
code to explore the following aspects of these websites:

* DNS Records
* Open Ports
* Cipher Suites
* Certificates
* Traceroutes
* Forms and Templates
* Operating Systems

We also attempted to guess 

Running our program was very time consuming, so we opted to run it for several days on a server

## Running Instructions



Run from thread_launcher.py, making sure to change the "8" in Line 127:
>  while len(running) < 8 and idx < min(len(url_list), start_index + number)

with the number of cores/threads you would like to run with.
